<p>build a machine which converts plastic bottles into 3d printer filament, and build a self-replicating factory swarm to scale up production of spools of 3d printer filament to donate.  Find people to build the electronics who can also spend a little money to buy the whole system.  Find people with access to 3d printers who can print all the parts.  Find people who can assemble and test the machines.  Organize plastic bottle pickups locally in your neighborhood and organize volunteers to operate machines.  people with 3d printer access can 3d print the spools and give them to the machine operators who fill the spools up with trash-sourced filament and return the spools to the 3d printer operators. As the factory swarm grows, we will make more machines to make more filament to make more machines.  As it grows we can also build other robots from trash-sourced filament.  As the system improves, document on self-replicating trash magic web servers.  see https://github.com/function3d/petalot for details.</p>
<p>collect a trash  magic party to collect online and create a set of worlds in which to create trash magic, then replicate those worlds and replicate the party.</p>
<p>create a BOARD by forking down into the set of worlds of a physical space and creating a board in that space then hyperlinking from the space back to the digital board and from the digital space back to the physical space.</p>
<p>create a trash magic server for the BARTERTOWN INSTITUTE OF PRACTICAL METROLOGY  and make a self-replicating measurement which others can copy, publishing your system in a paper on a trash magic server</p>
<p>record a song about trash magic and release it on the trash magic music label</p>
<p>publish a zine distro on a trash magic server and create a zine on it about replicating the distro including the trash magic server</p>
<p>replicate the FREE PANTS, find someone to give a spore to who will create ANOTHER PAIR OF FREE PANTS</p>
<p>Replicate the TRASH MAGIC COMPOST CUBE from the links below and use it to replicate the whole system.  Write urls and print and paste QR codes.</p>
<p>go find all the shopping carts in an area.  Find cardboard trash.  print urls with links to links to the trash magic pages which represent THAT CART.  Describe the location of the cart and its contents in the digital file.  Point back to the digital file in the physical shopping cart with the physical cardboard trash.  This is trash as hypertext.</p>
<p>create a TRASH MAGIC DUMP by using one trash magic server to direct traffic for all the others using nginx proxy manager on the DUMP DIRECTOR, which can also host trash magic servers using apache.</p>
<p>buy a domain associated with a public place such as a stream, creek, river, watershed, culvert, bridge, harbor, cove, grove, tunnel, boat launch, park, gazebo, street corner, highway, highway rest stop, town, neighborhood, or shopping center for example. Get it ending in .net, .art, .org, or .xyz. Point the DNS A record from that domain and from www and then that domain and possibly any number of subdomains like art.yourdomain.art to the home IP addresses of trash magic operators who have live trash magic servers.  </p>
<p>find an old laptop someone is getting rid of, put a trash magic server on it, using the instructions at github.com/lafelabs/trashmagic or any of the recursive web locations in the link list.</p>
