<h1>QUESTS</h1>

<p>
    metrology is the science and technology of measurement. the primary quests of bipm are to create self-replicating measurement science and technology built from trash. This means every measurement apparatus built contains the means of its own replication. Trash includes material donations or material already on hand, it just means we don't have to buy new things.  We get computers from the trash, install Ubuntu on them and then set them us as web servers and free public terminals outside of the system of property. these servers run the measurements 
</p>

<p>metrology trash magic quests are divided up into divisions, linked below</p>

<p>
    The purpose of Trash Magic is to create a civilization of free things entirely built from trash.  We will build things from trash, share them freely, and share how to build them with others so that they can replicate.  We call this replication from person to person of the knowhow and desire to make things "magic".  
</p>

<p>In the recursive web everything replicates, everything evolves, and everything dies.  We create and destroy WORLDS for QUESTS.</p>

<h1>DIVISIONS</h1>

<p>divisions include power, structural, thermal, electromagnetic, dark matter, low temperature and quantum, optical, nuclear, medical measurement and imaging, synthetic biology, bioinformatics/genomics, mycology, air, water, soil, mechanics, astronomy, geometry, linguistics and language model development, geology, roads and highways, tunnels, robotics, and millions of others, with fractal structure.</p>
