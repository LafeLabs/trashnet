<p>TRASH MAGIC QUEST: create CUBE from cardboard trash, geometry tools, box cutters, markers, QR code. Find quartz rocks and put them in the cube.  Cube points back here with QR code.  Put cube in spaces where you can run a TRASH MAGIC TERMINAL to edit this page, making the system fully hyperlinked between the physical place and the physical server at home and the physical terminal out in the place.  </p>

<p>quest: quartz rocks in a cube by the river, bike quest, friday the 13th jan 2023. Cube placed in the solar powered picnic tables right outside the Starbucks at the Tivoli building on the Auraria campus in Denver Colorado. </p>

<p>after cubes are being produced and quartz is being gathered and distributed via cubes, which are self-replicating the code, build a network of people who build rock tumblers  and polishers from trash to polish the quartz </p>


<p>WELCOME TO THE DIRT WEB.</p>


<p>find double-thick corrugated cardboard and cut out the patterns below, with 2 of the fourfold-symmetric panel pattern and 8 of the other one, then cut out 5 4 inch squares.  </p>

<p>
    in the dirt web we build cubes out of cardboard trash which can carry dirt.  We grow plants and fungi in dirt. We also use the cubes to carry art supplies like box cutters, elmer's glue and markers, and GEOMETRON rulers to make more cubes, making the cubes fully self-replicating.  If the cubes have a QR code which links back to this page, which tells how to make cubes and also to make more web servers from trash which host documents about how to make more servers and also cubes.  Cubes can contain cardboard media which can be hyperlinks, symbols, icons, geometric art, or functional elements like phone stands.  Cubes can also contain physical digital media like USB thumb drives.  Cubes are used as electronics enclosures and structural elements of robots.  When cubes break down over time, they are sterilized in pressure cookers and put in sealed bags with mushroom grow medium. Arrays of electrodes are inserted into grow medium, and the electrodes are connected to analog in and digital out of an Arduino or some related Adafruit product.  The Arduino is controlled by python code on a trash server which the community can co-edit and evolve over time into a system which applies pulses to the mycelium and recieves responses.  The goal of this evolution will be to make the mycelium behave as a programmable circuit which can run Geometron and Arduino-like code.  If they can run Arduino-like code, they can replace the Arduino which controls the pulses, making a system where the mycelium programs the mycelium, but is connected over USB to a server which random people from around the world can hack on.

    A compost cube is a cube made from trash, with compost in it and some seed of some plant which can create more plants. it self-replicating media, we can grow potatoes in the compost and replicate those potatoes to grow more potatoes, replicating the whole system.  Cubes can also hold replication supplies: rulers, box cutters, geometron shapes, glue, QR codes, scissors, pens, markers.
</p>


<p>this is the dirt net.  make a cube from trash, put dirt in it, move it around town, print a message on the side, put a thumb drive in the dirt, grow seedlings, grow fungi, draw symbols in the dirt.  make new qr codes which point to new places on the dirt net and put them on the cubes which are out on the street.  To get to the actual DIRT NET right here, this document, just click on the link to the qr code maker below.  Print those out, put them on cubes, put dirt in cubes, grow things in dirt, move cubes around as we build and evolve our mental universes.</p>

<p>
    The purpose of Trash Magic is to create a civilization of free things entirely built from trash.  We will build things from trash, share them freely, and share how to build them with others so that they can replicate.  We call this replication from person to person of the knowhow and desire to make things "magic".  
</p>

<p>THE RECURSIVE WEB IS MADE OF WORLDS AND QUESTS. YOU CONSTRUCT, REPLICATE AND DESTROY WORLDS AND QUESTS TO BUILD TRASH MAGIC.</p>

<P>
    If mushrooms are going to eat all the cardboard in the system, we need to have one of the types of cube contain cardboard as a grow medium of some kind of mushroom.  To do this, we'll need to get people to learn how to sterilize cardboard with a pressure cooker and then put the proper material into and onto the cardboard in order to turn it into mycelium and ultimately fruiting bodies.  We also want to make circuits which stimulate and read out the response of the mycelial network with electrodes, and connect these to the computers in the TRASH MAGIC network, which can run machine learning algorithms to evolve the circuit in the direction of something we can program with geometron.
