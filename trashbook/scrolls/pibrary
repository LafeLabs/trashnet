# 3. The Pibrary

This chapter needs to be re-written to update with the whole recursive web system, using trash-sourced servers to make recursive web pages which include TRASH MAGIC QUESTS.  


Perhaps the RECURSIVE WEB should be another chapter!


 
The Pibrary is a network of free books distributed using the Raspberry Pi, a very cheap open source computer designed primarily for educational use.  The goal of the Pibrary is to be an extension of the public library system into more public spaces and with more free and more local books.   

The Pibrary represents a fully free network, meaning everything is free of copyrights or other intellectual property, everything is available in a public space for use by whoever wants to use it, and everything can be freely replicated by other people in other places.  

The Pibrary is centered on public spaces, meaning spaces anyone can get access to without any restrictions such as public parks or public streets or any other outdoor space which we do not restrict access to based on money.  This can include private property as long as the owners of the property are willing to create a truly open space which welcomes all people regardless of social or economic status on a 24/7 basis.  

The free computing element of the Pibrary consists of mobile Raspberry Pi computers with portable battery and solar panel as a free community computing resource for use in public spaces by whoever has the greatest need for free access to information.  This can be an extension of other mutual aid projects like Food Not Bombs which provide basic goods and services for free to the most marginalized people in public spaces.  The solar panels and batteries can be used to power or charge mobile devices, a critical infrastructure need for unhoused or traveling people.  The Raspberry Pis are installed with no private data, no logins, no passwords, and are intended to be used that way so that they can be safely shared.  The only purpose of the Pi is to access the Internet for free, just like a free public computer in a public library.  

The basic Raspberry Pi mobile terminal setup consists of the Pi board which is about the size of a deck of cards and costs about $60, the SD card the operating system is installed on, a keyboard, a mouse, a small mobile screen, a 12 volt lead acid battery, and a solar panel and charger.  The whole system costs about $400 and can all be purchased online from many vendors.   In order to charge devices the kit must also have a 12 volt USB power hub to break out the battery power for charging USB devices.

The Raspberry Pi is also used as a home web server for creating, editing and sharing the self-replicating documents of the Geometron system.  To run a Pi at home we need a lot less infrastructure.  The keyboard and mouse and a standard TV or computer screen can be used once to set it up, it can be powered off of a wall plug, and then run "headless" with no screen or peripherals, accessed over entirely over the network.  This server can be accessed by people anywhere in the world by using port forwarding over the home router or router in a public space to connect it to the outside Internet.  

Internet access is provided for free in public spaces by wireless hotspots with clearly posted log on information.  We can beam Internet into public spaces with directional antennas and wireless network extenders.  All of this physical infrastructure is provided for free by donors from the local community.  It is a public resource.  

The primary purpose of all the media hosted on the Pibrary system is to create a free library of books which contain all the knowledge required to build a society based on the principles of the last chapter: built from trash and powered from the sun, wind and water.  This will include science, technology, history, culture, commerce, and any other deep knowledge about and for a local community.  All of these books consist of collections of documents which replicate freely from one server to another without any restrictions.  Each copy of each book can also be edited, deleted, or moved around on any server by anyone at any time.  

We must emphasize that we did not invent building useful things from trash and using them to help people.  What we are doing is gathering and curating a collection focused on this.  We are creating a layer of knowledge which is more focused than a search engine or wiki, which is exactly as broad a range of knowledge as we need to do our work to build a better world locally in a specific space and no more.  We are not replacing the Internet, the public library, or Wikipedia, we are creating a new layer of curated and focused knowledge on top of these.

The Pibrary is a network of free self-replicating books. This is not a network of users.  There is no private data, there are no users, no logins, no passwords, no encryption, and no databases.  While we are creating a vast universe of documents, each Pibrary will have a collection which is limited based on a focus of immediate interest for a relatively small community with a shared purpose.  Initially this just means the books created by Trash Robot to share the ideas of this network itself.

Part of the infrastructure of the Pibrary is domain names for public use which can host copies of all the documents in our system.  All of these public web pages, like the Raspberry Pi servers, have no private data, no users, and no databases.  Anyone can copy files onto them and off of them, or delete them at will.  Pages can be forked down to make more libraries with more books and more libraries inside libraries.  Whole forks can be deleted by anyone at any time.  Our resilience against deleting is to constantly copy books to many places again and again.  We are building media which behaves as a living organism, replicating, dying, and evolving as part of our culture as humans.  

The domain names for these public web pages are selected to correspond to public spaces like streets, parks or bodies of water, with top level domains other than .com so that they are not commercial and not personal.  Some volunteer from the community can buy the domain and pay for commercial cloud hosting at some standard web hosting vendor, and install the system on that server.  It generally costs about 10 dollars a year for the domain registration and another 10 dollars a month or so for the hosting.  As long as our network is providing significant community benefit this should be a relatively minor cost to get paid for by a volunteer.

We create physical flags to display in public spaces which point to the domains which host the books.  These flags are created by sewing solid rainbow colored felt letters in a block font onto a black cloth background about 3 feet by 3 feet square.   Flags, like everything else, are meant to be copied widely and displayed publicly.  Flags fly in physical spaces which are represented by domains which host books we create, edit and replicate using the network of free Raspberry Pi computers.

Another powerful tool in our network of self-replicating books is Github.  Github is a company which provides free(free for open source and that includes everything we do) hosting of documents which can be copied from anywhere on the Web.  We can create private instances of Geometron servers on home personal computers which have local web servers set up which only run on that machine.  These are used to edit local copies of the whole system including any books we want to save.  As these are replicated and edited, they can be "pushed" to Github with Github Desktop, a GUI(graphical user interface) app.  Using Github to move books around provides a backup where if servers are all wiped out the data can't be edited without access to a personal Github account which is based on Github's security.  Also Github has enough bandwidth and protection against surges in bandwidth that it can be a source for replication to many servers all at once.  Anyone anywhere in the world can copy whole libraries of books with simple clicks in their web browser to their personal Github repositories, then push it out to the public and copy from there to any other server.  This network of potentially millions of Github accounts and millions of Raspberry Pi's and millions of domain names can be constantly supporting a free flow of replication of books from server to server across the globe.   

The format of "books" on the Pibrary is the "magic book" described in the next chapter.  This library of free books can form the basis of a social network which provides the same benefits as modern networking applications but with direct community control.  Books can be created to document all commerce, organized by the people engaging in that commerce.  The same efficiency improvements which are currently monetized by Silicon Valley can then be kept in local communities, which will bring in enough wealth to materially support the people building the network.  As the amount of wealth generated by the network increases we will direct all excess to those in the local community with the most need.  

The use of the Network to direct resources to those in the most need is mutual aid.  The network helps people and those people help the network by representing it in public, sharing the information with as many people as possible.  This applies to everyone.  As the network generates more wealth it should be possible to eliminate poverty in very localized areas covered by the network.  As this happens we can use the network to build more and more industries up using the Trash Factories and this can amplify the process.  Network value in commercial activity funds industrial value which funds more network expansion and so on.  As the network grows and we can support more people, those people can solve harder and harder problems and scale up what we can make in the Trash Factories more and more.  As this knowledge is generated, it will all be synthesized into more free self-replicating books which are published onto the Pibrary network. So our manufacturing supports growth of the network, but the network is also supporting the growth of manufacturing by replicating all the knowledge required to copy our processes.

The Pibrary creates and enhances public spaces.   Selecting the right physical space to inhabit for this is one of the most important parts of building a successful network.  We need to choose spaces that have the absolute maximum possible intersection of people.  We must ask the question: if a place is about 10 yards across, what place in a given area a couple miles across has the widest range of people crossing it in any given day? Of places like this, what is the most freely accessible? We must evaluate accessibility based on sidewalks, access by car, access by public transit, by bike, wheelchair, or any other means of access relevant to the local community.  But we must also consider accessibility in terms of it being legal to be there, there being adequate restroom facilities nearby, places to rest or work or sleep, shade or other shelter, and a generally welcoming culture.

The public space being activated by a Pibrary does not need to always have a Raspberry Pi or solar panel.  It can just have a flag or sign or markers which point to the domain which has the copies of the books maintained about that place. It can even be invisible, with a known domain being used by people about a place without any obvious infrastructure in that place other than the place itself.

The Raspberry Pi can also serve as a monitor for the environment, measuring aspects of the water, air, soil, living things and anything else of interest to the community.  In rural areas, sequences of wireless network repeaters on off-grid power can go along rivers and streams with local Raspberry Pi's with sensors measuring water properties and delivering that information via the web to the rest of the network.  This can put the land, life, and water itself onto the network and connect all of us humans on the network more intimately with these systems.
