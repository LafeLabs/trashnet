# Install Geometron on a Windows machine

First, install XAMPP, a free open source web server for all platforms.  [Download from www.apachefriends.org](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).  Click on windows to download, and click through to install everything.

After you download and install it, run it and start Apache.  You should see a control panel like this:

Click on "Explorer" to get access to where the files are.  From the main directory called xamp, you want the sub-directory "htdocs".  Open this, delete the index.php file, and create a new file called replicator.php which you copy and paste the replicator at [php/replicator.txt](php/replicator.txt) into, and save.

Point a web browser on the same computer to [http://localhost/](http://localhost), then click on replicator.php.  This should replicate the whole system into the directory.  When this is done, click the link to go to the main page.  You should see a new Geometron instance:

When this loads, you need to get the IP address of this machine, which you do by clicking from the main XAMPP screen(shown at the top of this scroll) to "netstat".  You will now see a bunch of processes on various IP addresses.  Look at the web browser you opened which you pointed to "localhost" and you will see the IP address of this machine.  Create a link to it by starting with "http://" and then adding the IP address.  Share this link with yourself and anyone else on the local wifi network via email or text message or link on an existing server.

Also, to have a record of it which is easy to share, add a link to it at the top of the home scroll for the new server.  You can also add a link to qrcode.html at the top of the new home scroll so that it is easy to replicate a link from one mobile device to another when they are all on the same wifi network, all looking at the same Windows server.

To understand what this is for, read the [Book of Geometron](scrolls/bookofgeometron.md).  Learn to use the Factories.
