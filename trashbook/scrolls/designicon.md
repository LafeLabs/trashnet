# Design Icon

Icons are a type of symbol created with the Geometron language.  Icons are made up of pixels on a rectangular grid, approximately 64 by 64 pixels.  Once icons are designed, they can be printed in several ways at different scales.  This document describes how to create and share icons using Geometron.

## Step 1: Think of a symbol

This is the most creative step.  This can be anything: words, computer icons, symbols, signs, emoticons, or really any symbol in the most generalized sense. The only real limitation is that the limited number of pixels limits the resolution, so you should pick simple icons without too much detail.  It is good to first think of a thing you want to represent, then figure out the symbol for that thing.  "Thing" in this case can be a very generalized thing: ideas, objects, actions, places, people, brands, concepts, institutions, businesses, teams, logos, organisms, really anything.  

## Step 2: Either find or create an image of the symbol 

There are two paths to this: the [global image feed](globalimagefeed.html) and the [local image feed](localimagefeed.html).
