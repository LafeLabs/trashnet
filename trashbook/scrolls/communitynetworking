# Community Networking FAQ
 
**what is community networking?** Community networking is free network infrastructure which connects anyone with anyone else by mutual consent: if you want to send a message and someone wants to receive it, the operators will put the message through. If they don't want it, the operator will block it.  

**What is an operator?** Operators are people trained to create, replicate, and destroy documents in service to the community. 

**What can I do with a community network?**  You can share messages, stories, human connection, culture, history, food, water, housing, labor, ideas...anything which can be shared.  The Network exists to help anyone who wants to share anything with anyone else who wants to share.

**Is this a business?** No.  Network services are always provided for free to anyone who wants to share with no regard for ability to pay. Network operations help other people do business, but the operators themselves do not constitute a business.

**If this is not a business who owns it?** The software is all released into the Public Domain with no restrictions whatsoever so no one owns it.  The hardware is generally given away as part of STEM education programs funded by existing donors and operated through existing educational institutions or groups.  Part of our project of spreading the system is to donate the hardware to the community as a public free resource. It is maintained by Operators, but not owned by them, and can be passed from one to another without friction because there is no private information of any kind on any server.

**What about security?** The purpose of this network is the widest possible broadcast of messages to people who want to see them.  Security exists to prevent some people from accessing some information. This system has no barriers to the flow of information other than the consent of the recipient, which is ensured by responsible Operator activities.  Bad information can be immediately destroyed permanently at any time.

**What is the role of teachers in the Network?** Teachers are the foundation of network replication.  Teachers train Operators in both the technical and social parts of being a skilled and responsible caretaker of a community network.  Teachers teach technology, philosophy, mathematics, art, culture, politics, history, marketing, operations, and anything else we build into the system as it evolves.  At its core, this project can be thought of as a school, where the teachers make up a decentralized faculty doing both research and teaching just like university faculty.  In many cases, faculty will in fact *be* faculty at existing universities or k-12 schools.  In some cases they will be totally independent, or work for existing STEM education organizations outside of formal schooling.  None of this impacts the basic mission, which is to replicate the system of community networking to directly provide benefit to the material conditions of the communities in which students live.

**What is organic media?** Organic media follows three rules: 
1. everything replicates(any user can copy any document to any other server at any time)
2. everything evolves(any user can edit any document at any time)
3. everything dies(any user can destroy any document at any time)

**How does organic media differ from viral media?**  Viral media is self-replicating information which replicates on a fixed host of some kind with restrictions on host replication.  For example, memes can replicate freely on a commercial social media platform, but copying the whole platform is prevented by existing legal and business frameworks.  In organic media, the whole system replicates: physical servers, social structures built around them, all the code, the whole team of skilled technicians who can improve the code, the logistics of operating the network and growing it and benefiting from it...*all* of this replicates freely in our system.

**What does "community" mean here?** For the purposes of this discussion, we take "community" to be physical, and very local.  In many cases it will be for an area a mile across, located at a central place where many local people go like a public library, park, school, religious building, or grocery store.  We are in most cases building new types of communities which are currently not connected at all, such as all the commuters passing a certain street corner every day.  We will make local physical places the center of a new *type* of community which is fact the oldest type.

**If everything is local, how does this network connect globally?** Our network will be connected from one community to another, but we build connections based on the *physical* world, not abstract virtual notions of shared interest.  Our network will grow along natural physical network connections like roads and rivers, as well as other existing right of ways like power line trails.  Nodes are also still all on the Internet, this network does not replace the existing networks overnight, it is a new network layer making connections which do not exist in the current Internet or phone system.

**If this is not a business how do Operators survive the current money-based economic system?**  If this network creates the kind of value it has the potential to unleash trillions of dollars of new commercial activity within the existing capitalist system, but with a massive decentralization of control.  Our challenge if this happens will not be to find ways to support operators but to make sure no operator becomes too powerful, and that we do not end up replicating the same abusive power structures of Silicon Valley that this project aims to destroy.  This is why we center our entire project on education: it is the responsibility of the teachers in this meta-school to create a culture of mutual aid in which as the network grows more and more things are free by teaching a set of values compatible with that way of life.  If this grows as we expect it to, Operators will be able to "live for free" not by dominating networks like the tech companies but by simply being part of communities where *everyone* lives for free.

**How do we get all this started?**  Again, the faculty are at the center of the project, and that is where it all starts. We need a full curriculum in place which teaches enough marketable tech skills that a large cross sections of existing STEAM education programs will support it.  This all needs to be self-replicating in that the whole curriculum is built into self-replicating documents on the system.  This is what is currently being developed on [https://github.com/lafelabs/pi](https://github.com/lafelabs/pi).  What is needed is a grant application template, in which anyone can apply for a grant, buy hardware, deploy it in a community, find students, and teach them the system using media contained in the system.

**How much does one system cost?**  The Pi with a screen and all the basic parts is about $250, a second board for a home server is about another 50, and the solar setup is about 100, so about $400 gets a full setup with a home server, and outside off-grid server. Buying domains is also helpful, but those can be just a few dollars.  


# Use cases

 - open science platform
 - learn web development for jobs in tech
 - help the community with tech issues, be free IT support to bridge digital divide
 - help local small business owners to get around the blockade from Big Tech to get directly to the people they serve
 - personals ads, dating, find-a-friend, direct personal connections
 - organizing drivers at an airport, where operators act as dispatchers, put ride sharing out of business
 - any "sharing economy" predatory silicon valley app can be replaced with operators combined with free servers

# Workflow

1. operator stands in public place with a large, attractive, and clearly branded sign pointing to a domain running a server
2. operator has a free public raspberry pi terminal/server with them which they can use to edit documents locally
3. operator replicates documents from their local server to a home raspberry pi server which uses port forwarding to get information out to the public internet
4. operator uses document set replication to replicate all documents from their terminal to their home server and from there to the public page, updating the public page without ever logging into anything or using a password.  
5. operator keeps tabs on all servers and backs them up to multiple locations so that any corrupted documents are replaced by other replications quickly.  We want documents which are like insects: they die constantly, but breed faster.

# Hardware Elements

 - raspberry pi terminal/server with self-contained batter, wall power, solar, 
 - arduino based sensor which senses something about the environment and sends down serial on pi, water science toolkit
 - off-the-shelf hardware to extend internet links from some source of very cheap high bandwidth out to all the hot spots, which are along waterways and right of ways
 - wifi hotspots for free internet in public areas, connected from the wireless repeater links
 - self-contained solar power and battery system for each repeater on the wireless links


Port forwarding on routers allows each pi to use internal server names linked to external router ip addresses, with no need for any purchased domains. This means we can have significant repetition of names, with the same name pointing to an analogous place like "thecorner/" in a huge number of places globally. This builds up a local geography which is repeated again and again from one locality to another globally.

#  What is Community Networking?[old]

 - the purpose of the network is to be a free resource for everyone in a community to share information with everyone they want to
 - all software is free and open source on a Public Domain license with no restrictions
 - all software contains scripts to automatically replicate to other servers
 - this is a network of places, living things, documents, and messages, not of "users"
 - there are no private data on this network, all documents and applications are public utilities
 - there is no "security", no passwords, no log ins, no user names
 - every document can be replicated to any server by any person at any time
 - every document can be edited by any person on any server at any time
 - every document can be deleted by anyone on any server at any time
 - communities are physically defined and local
 - no cloud, every server is understood and controlled individually by an operator
 - trained operators operate servers in each community
 - operators are trained to train more operators
 - all network stations are powered by off-grid electricity directly generated and stored on site
 - all stations extend network coverage from other existing stations or existing Internet connections
 - the network can operate locally even if the Internet is disconnected
