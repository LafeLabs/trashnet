# Ontology

1. the branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being.
2. a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them.

We consider things in the most abstract sense.  From things we create sets, which are also things.  This section is a more formal mathematical treatment of the material in the "magic" chapter.  It is more technical than that chapter, and does not reference magic, but does reference our specific implementation. 

This is where the Theory of Self replicating sets is described. We point to the failures of the project of set theory in the 20th century, how it was a dead end, and how we can navigate out of the dead end by placing the mathematicians ourselves in the sets we describe. The whole failure of the old models of self replicating machines(perhaps this gets moved back to organic media chapter).  

set notation, departure from ZF-C paradigm. New way of dealing with foundations of mathematics: the mathematician is part of the sets considered.  And we continue this through the whole construction of math.  

Foundational math in the paradigm of the 20th century was from ZF-C set theory to arthmetic, to algebra, to geometry, etc...but the whole edifice is based on sets which follow axioms, but those sets do not contain their makers.  We create a foundation of mathematics in which the creators of the math are always in their own calculations, starting at the primitive level of what an "object" is and what a set of objects is.  We consider not only ourselves to be elements of the sets in our universe, but every aspect of ourselves, our communities, our minds, and our ecosystems.  For example, looping back to SRS, the desire to replicate a set is part of the set.  A set might be 

{
 - powerpoint slide about self replicating sets
 - the desire to tell people about self replicating sets
 - the persuasiveness to induce others to desire to tell people about SRS
 - the means to replicate the powerpoint to the next user(e.g. posted on slideshare)
}

From these sets we construct geometry which is used to make generalized symbols, which are used to make all the things in our technological complete set, which is again a part of our new approach to interacting with abstract sets.
