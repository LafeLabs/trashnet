# Full Geometron
 
 - what it is: everything built from trash, powered locally by natural forces, all media is open and free, self-replicating 
 - seizing control of fiber, building switching stations from trash
 - building mesh networks from trash 
 - building carbon/aluminum electrochemical cells to store electric power to run the Geometron systems
 - Describe a geometron station around a trash factory as intro
 - the human structure: a network of replicators organized around self-replicating libraries and books as metaphors
 - how to make a more stripped down geometron processor with upcycled but working iot devices modeled on openwrt with a fork we make (geometroNIX) which just runs 
 - trash power system 
 - Arduino with stripped down iot devices, TRASHduino
 - divide into the section on what we build now and what we build in the future
 - the case against computers
 - geometron processor model
 - discuss various architectures: electroplate fabrication, fungal growth fabrication, bacterial growth fabrication, plant growth fabrication, wiring links to nonlinear components from trash circuit boards
 - some calculations of fabrication time of processors
 - a geometron processor for display of text on screens
 - image stack
 - maps as fundamental structure in screen control
 - how to move wikipedia into our system
 - how our system can build full trash magic
 - fabrication and automation with geometron processors and switch arrays
 - how geometron processors can be used for video and sound
 - how to grow a geometron processor, sketch out architecture of ab initio fab
 - craft mode of production of processors
