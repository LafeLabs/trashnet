# WEB SERVERS NOT BOMBS!
 
THE WEB SERVER IS THE KALASHNIKOV OF THE 21ST CENTURY!
 
PICK UP OLD LAPTOPS IN THE [TRASHCARTS](scrolls/TRASHCARTS)!

INSTALL LINUX ON THE LAPTOPS, TRANSFORM THEM INTO TRASHNET SERVERS!  GIVE THE SERVERS AWAY IN THE CARTS! FILL THE CARTS WITH FREE SERVERS!  RUN THEM ON THE SOLAR!

[GO REPLICATE THE SERVER USING THE GITHUB](https://github.com/LafeLabs/trashnet)

TO INSTALL A TRASHBOOK ON A TRASHSERVER, YOU WILL WANT TWO USB THUMB DRIVES!  ONE WILL HAVE THE UBUNTU INSTALL IMAGE AND THE OTHER WILL HAVE THE TRASHBOOK FILE SYSTEM!  

FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO INSTALL UBUNTU AT UBUNTU DOT COM!  BE SURE TO DESTROY ALL OLD DATA ON THE LAPTOP!

INSTALL APACHE, PHP, AND TRASHNET FROM THE COMMAND LINE AS FOLLOWS!

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php -y
cd /var/www/html
sudo rm index.html
sudo apt install curl
sudo curl -o replicator.php https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashnet/main/php/replicator.txt
cd ..
sudo chmod -R 0777 *
cd html
php replicator.php
sudo chmod -R 0777 *
```

TURN APACHE OFF SO THAT YOU CAN SWITCH TO RUNNING NGINX PROXY MANAGER ON PORT 80!

```
sudo update-rc.d apache2 disable
sudo service apache2 stop
```


INSTALL DOCKER!

IN THE CODE BELOW REPLACE "PI" WITH THE CORRECT USERNAME ON THAT SERVER!


```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker pi
sudo reboot
```

GO TO THE HOME DIRECTORY FROM THE COMMAND LINE AND OPEN A FILE CALLED docker-compost.yml
```
cd ~
sudo nano docker-compose.yml
```

COPY AND PASTE THE FOLLOWING CODE!

```
version: "3"
services:
  app:
    image: 'jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest'
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      # These ports are in format <host-port>:<container-port>
      - '80:80' # Public HTTP Port
      - '443:443' # Public HTTPS Port
      - '81:81' # Admin Web Port
      # Add any other Stream port you want to expose
      # - '21:21' # FTP

    # Uncomment the next line if you uncomment anything in the section
    # environment:
      # Uncomment this if you want to change the location of 
      # the SQLite DB file within the container
      # DB_SQLITE_FILE: "/data/database.sqlite"

      # Uncomment this if IPv6 is not enabled on your host
      # DISABLE_IPV6: 'true'

    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
```

AND THEN RUN DOCKER WITH THE FOLLOWING COMMAND!

```
docker compose up -d
```

When this is set up, either go to [http://localhost:81](http://localhost:81) on the DUMP DIRECTOR or point a browser on another machine on the network to [ip address of DUMP DIRECTOR]:81 to get to the control panel. Create a proxy host for each of the various domains you are pointing to your home network. You need a separate entry for [domain].[tld] than you do for www.[domain].[tld]. You can forward to any TRASH SERVER on the local network by IP address this way. After they're set up, edit the entries to add ssl "let's encrypt" certificates. Also be sure to add forwarding of the service "https" on your home router on port 443(you've already got port 80 from the above TRASH MAGIC SERVER setup).  Also, you can use this to forward traffic from subdomains(which should all also be forwarded from the DNS records at wherever the domain is registered).

Now to set up the DUMP DIRECTOR server to also be a web server again, we need to make apache listen on port 8080 instead of port 80, and create folders for each page we want to host on there.  
```
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
sudo nano 000-default.conf
```
Change the port from 80 to 8080 in this file and save it. Use the server fork to create forks named after each domain, spelling out domains, for example southplattedotnet/ or sloanslakedotart.  Copy the .conf file to create one for the new page:
```
sudo cp 000-default.conf southplatte.net.conf
sudo nano southplatte.net.conf
```
and then make sure the port is 8080 and not 80 and edit the file as follows:

```
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/southplattedotnet
    ServerName southplatte.net
    SeverAlias www.southplatte.net
```

Now we want to turn apache back on with 

```
sudo service apache2 start
```
and then load that site in particular and then reload apache with 
```
sudo a2ensite southplatte.net
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

add subdomains, add more domains, point any domain or subdomain to any dump and any trash server.  Go find more laptops people are willing to donate and make more trash servers and dump directors.  Use this system to create full trash magic globally.


WHEN A TRASHSERVER IS LIVE, CONVERT IT TO BEING A TRASHBOOK BY CLICKING THE LINK TO TRASHBOOK, COPYING THE REPLICATOR, THEN NAVIGATING BACK TO THAT PAGE AND RUNNING THE REPLICATOR.
