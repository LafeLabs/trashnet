# Textile

There are two types of textile products used in the Trash Robot system: flags and bags.

In all cases the raw materials are [black cotton flannel](https://www.joann.com/comfy-cozy-flannel-fabric-solids/16681074.html) or some similar equivalent found in a waste stream, [felt sheet](https://www.joann.com/craft-felt-fabric-72-solids/407288.html) of the rainbow colors plus black and white, and trash ties of both length(6 feet of clothesline terminated with duct tape and 18 inches of nylon parachute cord terminated in burned ends), the same as are used in [skeletron](scrolls/skeletron).

Flags are created by cutting a square of black cloth 38 inches on a side, then folding the edges and sewing a hem 1 inch in.  Then the hem is cut in several places along the line, approximately every 3 to 6 inches to allow the flags to be tied to things. The Trash Robot Font is used to create letters which are sewn onto the flag.  One side has "TRASH ROBOT" as shown, the other has whatever domain name is being used to point to the local Trash Robot network node.  Letters cycle through the colors of the rainbow, and generally start as squares either 3 or 4 inches on a side.


Flags are used for advertising, branding, and also as a surface on which all the other physical media and technology can be displayed, as a black background which matches the look and feel of the digital layer of the system.

Bags are used to store tokens and other elements of the clay art system which the robot prints in, to store the robots, to store the Raspberry Pi Trash Robot Terminals, and other technological artifacts created in the Trash Robot system.  Bags come in different sizes and have some standard patterns shown here.  Symbols are sewn in felt on bags to indicate what their purpose and contents are.  Specific symbols with patterns which can be created with a Geometron Shape Set are used for the robot bag, terminal bag, and the bags of clay corresponding to the "earth", "fire" and "water" elements.  These are shown below.
