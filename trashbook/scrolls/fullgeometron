# 11. Full Geometron

[podcast episode](https://anchor.fm/trashrobot/episodes/Reading-from-Chapter-11-of-Geometron-Magic-e1t6obc)
 
We will make everything from trash, without exception. We will abolish all global supply chains and mining and make things using only the materials in our immediate environment.  Our media will be outside the property system, merely a shared resource which we use to replicate all the things in our replication-based economy of trash and sun.  However, all this will take time. Decades. We have to start somewhere.  

We must start with the minimum required to have media which is not property and which can carry the knowledge needed to replicate itself.  That is the Raspberry Pi and the associated systems described in this work.  However, in order for this to get where we need to go, it has to have a *path* forward to full Trash Magic.  We do not have the resources to do the whole thing at once, nor would it be desirable to do so if we did, since large intense efforts tend to create systems which continue to require that form of effort.  

The first phase of the network described here is enough to start, to get natural replication without any external input from grants or startup capital.  The Raspberry Pi can be used to make social media which generates sufficient value both inside the marketplace of money and property and outside of it that it should sustain growth.  When this growth starts to ramp up, however, it will pull more and more materials and energy into the network naturally.  The natural next step after the Raspberry Pi is to start pulling in more mainstream hardware platforms.  This system only needs a web server and the language PHP to work and it can be replicated.  This can be done on Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, and any type of Linux.  So ultimately the number of servers can get up into the billions once these start getting switched from private to public use.

Any given server added to our system of common media adds a certain amount of value to a local community. When that amount of value is perceived as being greater than the price of a thing or the value of the thing to its owner, people will naturally start moving hardware from the property system to the Geometron network.  As with all network growth dynamics, the value will continue to increase exponentially with the number of elements on the network.  As we cross more and more thresholds of value, more and more hardware will transfer over.  

Of course, the Raspbery Pi and all these commercial off the shelf machines all still come from a mine.  They all still have a finite life time and are deliberately designed to be unusable after that lifetime.   In some sense using them doesn't solve any real problem of Trash Magic as they still are all bought for money from an unsustainable system.  The next step in our path of conversion is to start using a wider range of hardware so that more and more waste can be used in our system which was on its way to the landfill.  To do this, we must turn to the "Internet of Things".  This jargon term is used to denote putting computers in poorly designed products which should not have computers in them.  Generally they solve no real problem and are designed to break as fast as possible with no possibility to repair.  However they are a fantastic resource for us, since they all have to have basic Internet capability by definition.  

Our task with these devices is to develop processes which are easy to replicate which remove everything that is not needed from these machines, remove all proprietary software and all the hardware other than the basic Internet connectivity parts, and put a stripped down operating system the sole purpose of which is to host Geometron documents.  As with all tasks like this, the way to do this is with a fork of Linux based on other forks designed for this kind of task.  A perfect example of this already widely in use is OpenWrt, which is widely used for making routers useful for all sorts of things.

The path above is sufficient to build our global media network outside the system of property, which can be used to replicate things made from trash, while still feeding off the existing extraction based system.  We now turn our attention to the ultimate goal of freedom from that system.

All of our modern electronics comes from a vast and powerful web of supply which is very centralized, very brittle, and very unsustainable.  Huge quantities of sand with special properties are extracted from the few places in the world where they can be found and transported with oil thousands of miles to the few places in the world where microfabrication happens.  This sand is melted in specialized furnaces into giant crystals of insanely pure silicon, which is sliced into wafers.  The wafers are then put through a mass production process where each wafer has thousands of  chips and each chip has billions of transistors and other components.  These combine to make giant arithmetic engines which have clocks pulsing as fast as possible, generally billions of times a second.  All the functions of our "computer systems" are based on this very fast arithmetic engine.  This all looks a lot like replication, with many dice being stamped out which are identical to one another, but it's not quite the same.  They are replicated, but the whole system is not freely replicated.  Intellectual property, control of supply chains, and access to the vast amount of capital required to build these multi billion dollar facilities all make it so that the *system* is designed not to replicate.  

We must build a new fabrication system from the ground up if we are to free ourselves from the mine and oil system.  To do this, we rethink the purpose of the machines we are building.  We do not want to do arithmetic.  We want to do geometry.  We want our machines to do the absolute minimum work required to make the things we want to make and to display information to humans.  Furthermore, everything we are building is designed to be controlled directly by humans.  When a device is not being used and not carrying out a fabrication task it should do *nothing*, take no energy at all.  When a media machine is displaying a static document, the pixels should be energized, and nothing else.  All action is initiated by a human, and leads to response not based on clocks but on direct sequences of actions which take as long as they take.  

We do not realize how large the inefficiencies are in our current systems because they have seemingly blown up overnight and we have nothing to compare them to.  Also, they grew up in parallel with advances in the fundamental science, so we have no perspective on what is possible with today's science given advances in understanding of things like organic semiconductors or various exotic materials which did not exist in the mid 20th century as the current system was evolving.  Also, the growth of the current system involved vast amounts of extraction to get the various special atoms needed to create novel electronic devices.  

But our whole situation is vastly different now than in the 20th century!  Because of the trash feed, we now have every exotic atom available locally to every single person on Earth.  Wherever any of us are right now at this moment, there is a pile of electronic junk which is all identical in its atomic composition and which has every exotic element from antimony to zirconium not only available but in a well understood and perfectly repeated format.  So while it might be *difficult* to figure out how to use some exotic atom found in a trashed television, in a replication based economy we only need to do it once and then push that media out to the global feed and the whole world gets it for free with no supply chain at all.  This is a situation totally unlike any that has ever existed in human history! We cannot possibly overstate the power of this situation.  Even if our civilization totally collapses, any future civilization which evolves will always take this as a starting point, will not have to mine to create whatever they create.  The product of a globalized consumer society cannot be undone: the redistribution of atomic wealth is permanent.

Also, our economic constraints are totally different than those under which the technology we wish to replace were constructed.  The economic forces which created our existing microelectronic fabrication systems always favor size, power, and speed, at the expense of the ability to repair anything.  The faster the chips produced go to the landfill, the more money the factories make. The more money they make, the bigger they can get, which lowers price, which makes them go faster and so on.  We now aim to break that cycle and build much simpler and slower things which we can repair indefinitely.  If an artifact is intended to effectively last forever, being repaired and repurposed and reused indefinitely, with all the atoms staying in a physical locality permanently, we want to shift from mass production to craft production.  We no longer need chips to come out of a factory by the billions or to all be the same and have no defects.  If a single circuit takes months to build and requires a skilled craftsperson, that is acceptable to us as long as that circuit can be kept in the community for many decades or centuries.  This represents a totally different culture of creation, in which circuits are made directly by communities for their own benefit, but based on knowledge which replicates freely across humanity on the Geometron network.  

So what is all this for and how will we build it?  We primarily want to do two things: control the machines that are used for physical fabrication(printers, 3d printers, laser cutters, milling machines, lathes, etc.) and control the screens which make up the media.  We do all of this with Geometron.  In Geometron, machines manipulate units of geometric action, and then use those units to do physical things.  

We first look at what this means for fabrication machines.  In the current system, all fabrication machines are based on Arduino.  The Arduino is a simple open source hardware system.  It is easy to buy, cheap, and easy to program.  To program the Arduino with Geometron we simply create functions which do geometric actions, and build a geometric instruction set which controls those.  So for example with the robots built out of broken DVD drives we use for clay fabrication, the function has actions for moving left, right, up, down, forward, and back by one unit, actions to double unit and actions to halve unit, and nothing else.  Programs are simply sequences of these actions.  Since these are just geometry, they can also be translated to meaning in a canvas element of a web browser, and connected with symbols which are both displayed in the browser and painted on keys to be programmed with a physical keyboard.  This is how we are able to program robots in a web browser with no arithmetic. The universal nature of geometry allows geometric programming from a browser to turn into a sequence of actions on a robot which then turns into physical things, forming a replication technology of those things.  

To make complex things like printed characters in a human language like English, we also create a Geometron Hypercube which allows some actions to consist of sequences of actions.  So for instance "draw the letter A" will translate to a sequence of "draw a pixel" actions, and each of *those* actions is itself a sequence of actions to move a tool in whatever way is needed to draw a pixel, like poking a nail into clay or lowering a drill press to drill a hole.  In the Arduino, this Hypercube is expressed using strings made up of letters.  The Arduino, like all Geometron Virtual Machines, takes a tape of geometric actions in this case represented by letters and does something, in some cases another sequence of letters which can in turn call more sequences of letters, and all of these sequences are just strings.  Programs created in the browser will generally have a text area on the screen which displays the Arduino code which has the correct strings for the program.  This is then copied into the Arduino, uploaded, and we complete the connection from browser to machine.  

This system can be used to control *any* fabrication tool, and part of creating our own new way of making things is to close that loop in all cases.  We need to be using pure geometric programming in a web browser to control the tools which fabricate circuits, metal machines, metal molds for plastic parts, cut wood parts, moving biological samples for synthetic biology and indeed *every* fabrication task.  All fabrication is geometry. All geometry can be expressed in sequences of actions defined using only geometry and denoted to humans using only symbols also created geometrically in a web browser.  Therefore it is possible to use the Arduino and Raspberry Pi to build up a new type of web based self-replicating technology.  

However, as with the Geometron server, we note that the system based on Arduino is still reliant on the mine and oil cycle we are trying to escape.  To escape this, we first need the Arduino based fabrication machines to be making microelectronic circuits.  This can be slow.  It can be crude, with large devices initially.  But ultimately it is the start of the process to replace the whole system with full Trash Magic.  

What we want from the hardware which replaces the Arduino is just movements of motors with timers, and a hardware implementation of the Geometron Hypercube and Geometron Virtual Machine.  So we want a physical medium of some kind to have information encoded in it in a way which triggers a set of switches which choose what thing happens.  This can be purely mechanical, or combine electrical and mechanical, and even biological and chemical or fluid mechanics.  All that is needs to do is map states of the incoming tape to periods of time of some state of the actuator which moves a physical thing.  There are probably in practice many ways to do this. It could certainly be done using a primitive copy of existing technology, based on silicon and deliberately added impurities.  But that is probably not the most effective path.  We have learned a *lot* about organic electronic devices, biological and chemical systems, and even mechanical design in the last hundred years and we have no idea how many simple solutions to our problem will present themselves until we try. 

Always, our goal is to keep in mind the basic notion of turning physical media on the incoming glyph tape into geometric actions.  There is already significant precedent for doing this without modern computers in the automation systems of the early 20th century.  But again, what we are doing is much easier than what they did because we no longer need the extremely large scale, we are only trying to build systems which move 2-5 motors relatively slowly doing simple things for craft-based production. 

Once we can make our own circuits from scratch using found trash materials which control motor motion, we immediately make sure this can be used to print the physical media which forms the incoming Geometron glyph tape.  This basic system, where we replace the Arduino with our own circuits, use those to make fabrication robots which print the code which prints the circuits which makes the robots and so on, we have started to fully close the media loop.  If this is done using prints on clay, and those prints are used to fabricate human readable media, machine readable media, and circuits, that closes all the loops.  We then want to move from that up to screens, by building electronic circuits the sole purpose of which is to control what pixels light on on a screen when, again with purely geometric programming.  This is the final step in full Geometron.  When we can control old trashed screens from the existing system using circuits we can make ourselves from scratch using robots we make with that same technology we have a fully self-replicating trash based media which requires no mines or global supply chains. If this media carries all the code to control all the machines to build more media we have full self-replication.

There are many steps left out here.  Not all media will be discrete geometric actions.  We also need to be able to display bitmaps and play sound.  This means we need physical media which directly stores those, which will mean going back to more analog media using our physical media fabrication.  Digital media as an alternative to analog media is *primarily* a tool of domination and control.  When media is part of a giant system of arithmetic, the only added "value" of that is that it makes it possible to impose controls on what can or cannot be played.  Returning to analog, and then combining that analog with discrete geometric controls of where it will get displayed as well as direct human controls seizes power back from the people who have used computers to dictate and control our lives.  The machines we are building here are not "computers".  They perform the same functions as computers but we use different metaphors to describe them and that totally changes how we relate to them.  Removing computers from our lives is a political act, and we cannot do it soon enough! 

This fully self-replicating trash-based media is then used to carry the evolution of our other systems, documenting the research and development process as we approach our final goal of building everything to provide all human needs for free for all people everywhere from the sun, trash, water, and the living Earth.  This might sound outlandish, but as we hope we have shown, it is not.  Each step in this path is something straightforward which can be done using simple experimentation with already-working technology.  No miraculous new technology is required here, like molecular nanotechnology or strong AI.  This is just a choice to build a new culture and a new society based on a shared value set.  It is not really new technology, and that is why we know it will work.
