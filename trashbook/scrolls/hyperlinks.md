# Hyperlinks

What is the point of networking? It is to link things.  This is the most fundamental service we will provide to the world with the Organic Web: linking things to other things.   We use the term "hyperlink" to refer to any kind of linking from one thing to another, by whatever means are available.  Connections are the basis of everything people do.  When people share, give, take, sell, buy, create, help, join or collaborate, we need first to connect.  

To make this specific, this generally means one of a few things:

 - A software link to a document which can be shared via text message or email or clicked on in a document
 - A QR code which can be scanned by a mobile device which connects to a software link
 - Physical media pointing to a domain
 - Documents pointing to physical things/places/people/times

This sounds abstract.  It is abstract in order to have the maximum possible generality, but is mostly just a fancy way of describing almost all kinds of communication people might want to do in order to go about their lives.  An advertisement is a hyperlink, in that it links the viewer with whoever places the ad.  A sign in front of a shop is a hyperlink to the inside of the shop.  A document explaining how to make a thing is a hyperlink to a replication of that thing.  A document with a sequence of linked memes which describe how to get to a certain place at a certain time where a web server will be on a certain network is a hyperlink to that server.  A business card is a hyperlink.  A resume is a hyperlink.  A network in which riders are matched with drivers is a network of hyperlinks between riders, drivers, destinations, and pickup locations.  

All the things Silicon Valley has done to dominate society are based on them controlling the creation of manipulation of hyperlinks.  By building a freely replicating network which can support itself in the wild we allow people to build physically local networks where people can create and share whatever hyperlinks are useful without any interference from a central authority(corporate or state).  

While our servers are local, we are still on the public Internet in most cases, and the use of certain central free repositories as well as of our own hosted domains allow for all documents in the system to replicate globally in seconds.  A document can in theory replicate out in a tree structure, where each copy of the document is copied to a few hundred, copying to every node on a 10 billion person network in just a few generations(in theory).   Since everyone on the network can edit any document and copy it back out to anyone else, this can have a complexity which scales much faster than that of centralized networks.  

It is our view that a network which has a more powerful scaling law will always defeat the one which scales more poorly.  Put another way, anything with higher information density will generally win over something with lower information density.  Our network can have a vast complex informational structure on just a single street corner, where a centralized network will only have a couple links to the best-funded local businesses and a single image from some passing car.  A richer network provides more value.  Tech companies base their business on control of access to information.  If a network which has no property, no usernames and therefore no user data is more information-rich than theirs, it will easily grow powerful enough to starve their network of energy.  

Initially we can scale via the Raspberry Pi, maybe to a few million nodes(so maybe 100 million users). But the basic architecture of a very stripped-down web server with no property of any kind(no names, no users, no logins, no passwords, no personal information) on wifi running Linux Apache and PHP can be installed on pretty much any hardware, including obsolete hardware.  As we scale up we will develop and replicate scalable methods of acquiring waste streams of machines which can serve in this way, setting them up as servers, and releasing them freely into the Street.  Once we start using waste cell phones and Internet of Things devices, this network can scale to all of humanity relatively quickly.  If the number of clients and servers per human is more than one for all of humanity, and all of these are not property, but rather are a common resource, it will no longer make sense to have any private devices.  If these devices are used to replicate documents which replicate other technology built from trash, we can totally replace existing civilization with one built from free things made from trash.  


## path of links:

1. physical media in a public place points to a non-property domain
2. domain points to a place and time for a server, instructions to find and get on wifi
3. Raspberry Pi server with no property on it(no logins, no user data at all, never use to log into anything, is not owned by anyone has been released to the Street) has link which can be texted, posted to server or transmitted by QR code for local IP address
4. Raspberry Pi loads a link feed which has links to scrolls and maps
5. maps lead back to physical places
6. scrolls lead to replication of physical things
