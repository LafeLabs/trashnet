## parts

- 3 4-wire ribbon cables terminated in 4-pin 0.1" pitch headers, taken from 3d printer motor cables which [can be bought on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PZWXBFB/).  Trim to 12 inches on the side with the 4 pin as opposed to 6 pin connector.
- 3 DVD drive motion stages taken from taking apart DVD drives which can be purchased on ebay for about 5 dollars in lots of a few
- velcro strip, both sides, cut into 2 1" squares on the hook side and 2 rectanlges 0.5"x1" on the fuzzy side
- 4 little disk magnets, about 3/8" diameter or 1/4" diameter
- HDPE from milk bottles cut into two 1 inch square pieces and a rectangle which is 1.65"x1"
- Thick plastic from the lid to plastic totes(generally 1/16th inch polypropylene), 2 pieces 1"x4"
- small nail with a flat enough head to stick vertically on the magnet
- large quantities of corrugated cardboard, cut into 
    - 6 squares 1.75"x1.75"
    - 3 rectangles 4"X5"
    - 36 0.6"x0.6" squares
    - 3-4 rectangles 14"x5" 

## tools and materials

- rainbow duct tape
- ohm meter(DVM)
- wire cutters/strippers
- assorted screwdrivers to disassemble DVD drives
- box cutters
- scissors
- gorilla glue 2 part epoxy
- elmers glue
- paint pens

Mark and score HDPE sheets. Down the middle for the square parts.  0.5" in from edge on rectangular one.  Duct tape joints with HDPE on the "botom" side as shown.  Stack magnets with one on top of the central HDPE piece, nail on the bottom.  Add adhesive backed velcro strips.

Add 0.5"x1" velcro to tool, fuzzy side.

## Stage preparation

Use ohm meter to check which pairs of contacts are connected.  Pairs will be about 10-12 ohms between contacts. Non-pairs should be effectively infinite resistance.

Cut cables to 12 inches if you have not done so.  Strip ends. Solder to stepper motors

Flip stages upside down, stack 0.6" squares up until they form an even level in 4 towers of 3 units, subtracting layers as needed to end up with all pillars level and with the level extending enough to prevent interference with motion of stage.  Use gorilla glue epoxy to fix stacks permanently in place, using the epoxy like mortar and the cardboard squares like bricks. When dry, use another epoxy joint to mount the stages to the 4"x5" rectangles.  Flip over and use epoxy to stack 2 squares on each stage(these are the 1.75" squares).  Choose the order of the stages on the final robot, attach 1 inch squares of the hook side of the adhesive backed velcro strips to the outer two.  

Use elmers glue to laminate together the three-four large boards(5x14). Wrap the board in rainbow duct tape. Epoxy the three stages to the board as shown.  Try both orientations of each connector on robot, test, if the directions are wrong, swap the orientation.  Mark the connectors with paint pen facing away from the robot brain, from left to right as red, then green then blue.
