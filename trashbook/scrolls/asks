# Crowd Sourcing: Asks
 
I, the author am asking you, the reader, for help in building the things described in this book. Only a single person responding to a single thing here will be enough to make it worth it.  All we need is for each thing to get copied once, then get copied again, and again...but initially just a single copy of each action is needed to scale.

 - make videos of all the things in the [video list](scrolls/videos)
 - find a raspberry pi or buy one and install the system, use it at home
 - find a person with a raspberry pi who will let you install the system on their machine(clean install)
 - build a street book which is a set of geometron cardboard signs in a public space with a set of game tokens on them left in public, and a self-replicating map book connected to the physical street hosted on a public web page linked from the cardboard, a flag a bag of tokens
 - build a local Book of Commerce for a place with a directory of all commercial activities in a physical location(extremely local yellow pages)
 - put a raspberry pi server on the Internet using a home network connection
 - buy a domain name for a physical location, install geometron on it, share with the community
 - create a flag, sign or marker for a domain and post it in the physical space referred to 
 - write a book on how to build something useful and release it via the Pibrary network(put in specific asks for things)
 - book on solar power for mutual aid
 - book on free wireless hotspot architecture
 - use this platform to advertise your business
 - use this platform to promote your art
 - use this platform to promote your books
 - pay me for a year to spread this network no strings attached
 - pay me to build this network in your space, town, organization, land
 - pay someone else to do this
 - apply for a grant and then pay me
 - build a robot and share it, become a node for distribution of robot icon tokens
 - think of an icon token set, ask for it, let me make it and deliver it, replicate it freely, make an icon token factory based on the set, and replicate it out freely
 - think of an icon design and let me make it
 - ask someone else for an icon design idea and make it for them, let someone else print the thing out on the robot
 - make a shirt and give it away
 - buy the book and give it away
 - create a mixed reality game with the map book
 - create a history book of a place, publish on all platforms
 - find someone with a story to tell or a thing to build and co-create with them a book on it, release onto the Network
 - make social media content about how to replicate any part of this system(youtube, tiktok, instagram, hackaday, instructables, your web pages)
 - build a self-contained raspberry pi terminal with battery and solar panel and give away to whoever in your community has the most need for it
 - write a book about a physical place and release it via the Pibrary network
 - clone the code for the pibrary to your own Github repository and 
 - host a robot factory, I will come build robots and give them out to your community with community support
 - a grant proposal(bridge digital divide) for 50-100k to build a free wireless network and pibrary and train a community it its use, collaborating with the author
 - promote the Network using a large platform, promote this work
 - buy a hard copy of this book and give it away in a free book box, book share, book donation, or any public space where physical books are shared
 - print this out and bind it yourself in a three ring binder, give away in a book share
