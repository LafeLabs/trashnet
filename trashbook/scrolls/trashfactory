# TRASH FACTORY


**Action:** As you start making things and sharing them, make a list on this page of the products you are sharing.  Everything we build must have replication as part of our media, so add links for how to find the information to replicate all the things. This starts you blank and you add to it as you start to produce things.

What is trash factory? It is partly physical and partly virtual. It is a flow of materials and information which creates products for free distribution in the local community using materials also found locally.  

Initially our products are art, education, and social media.  Our highest priorities are to build a machine shop and textile mill, both of which are constructed using trash and run from the sun or flowing water or wind.  When we can build machines in a machine shop built from trash and run from ambient energy, we can self-replicate the system, and build machines for other manufacturing.  When we can use waste streams to manufacture textiles, we can build our own open self-replicating(no property) fashion and use it to make free garments and shelters for near term mutual aid and longer term replacement of all textile products from the consumer system.
