# WATERSHED


**Action:** List the waterways which define where you are, in order from large to small scale.  This can be a map or just a list, or a schematic map which just shows how rivers connect to one another.

WATER IS LIFE.  We re-center our entire cosmology on water.  What is the most local water? where does it go? Follow the water from sky to sea.
