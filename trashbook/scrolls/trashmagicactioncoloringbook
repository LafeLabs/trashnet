## Create the book

Print that document two sided, be sure to flip on short edge rather than long edge if that is an option with your printer.

Stack all the pages in order, and fold in half so that the booklet is 8.5 inches by 5.5 inches, and so that the front cover is on the outside, which says the title of the book.

Draw dots every half inch, using your eyeball to judge how far in from the edge to make it. Exact dimensions don't matter, just make it about that distance and as even as you can.  

Punch holes on each dot with a thumb tack, with cardboard in the back of the booklet so the tack has somewhere to push into other than your leg.  

Either staple down the spine or stitch by hand using a needle and thread with a back stitch.  Tie knots at both ends of thread, cut off extra thread.

Now draw your first TRASH ROBOT.  See this example:

The TRASH ROBOT avatar is just a rectangle with googley eyes and a black rectangle for a mouth, with 6 stripes colored in the simple rainbow sequence of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple. Notice the block letters which are based on starting with a square in your mind and just removing small simple amounts of the square to generate each letter.

This is the open brand of TRASH ROBOT.  Rainbows, googley eyes, and the block font with repeated rainbow colors.  This is simple, easy to copy, easy to recognize, and impossible to trademark.  No one owns this.  It belongs to us all.  We will be repeating this motif again and again in many media as we go along.
