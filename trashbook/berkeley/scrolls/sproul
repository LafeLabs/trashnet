BUILD A TRASH CAMP IN THE PLAZA.  BRING THE SHOPPING CARTS WITH THE CARDBOARD SIGNS AND THE TRASHNET SERVERS.  GATHER THE HACKERS.  ORGANIZE PEOPLE FROM HERE TO GO ON THE MISSIONS TO SPREAD TRASHNET.

There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart that you can't take part! You can't even passively take part! And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus -- and you've got to make it stop! And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it -- that unless you're free the machine will be prevented from working at all!!
