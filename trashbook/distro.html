    <h1>TRASH MAGIC ZINE DISTRO</h1>

<p>
    Print zines and put them in physical spaces which you document on the web page which is on the trashnet server which a domain points to which is on the zine which is about the space where the zine is.  EVERYTHING IS RECURSIVE!  Exchange USB thumb drives in the same physical spaces as you exchange physical zines, and use them to move zine files from one trash server to the next.  
</p>

<p>The quests of the zine operators are to get people to add zines to the zine distros which bring about full trash magic.  this includes technical documentation, art, culture, organizing, science, magic, politics, agriculture, philosophy, and mathematics we require to bring the entire world into trash magic.</p>

<p>To create a zine distro, make a TRASHNET server using the instructions linked below to the Gihtub, and create a subdomain for the distro which points to a folder in "/var/www/html" on the server. Copy this page "index.html".  Create a symbolic link using the linux command ln to make a desktop shortcut for the zines folder so that it is easy to find as you post zines to the folder.  Create signs which point to the URL for your distro(choose an easy to use subdomain), and add QR codes using the links for that.</p>
