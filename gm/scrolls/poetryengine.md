# Poetry Engine

The Poetry Engine is a good place to start in learning how to produce and share art on the Geometron network.  What this software does is point to any image on the Web, and allow you to place words over it of your choosing.  Delete words, add words, move words around, change them. It is the same basic format as refrigerator magnet poetry, which is where it gets its name.  However, by being able to point to anything on the Web, and being able to clone and remix across the web it becomes a tool of immense potential power to augment human thought and understanding. 

First, we will learn to edit the existing state of the Poetry Engine.  To do that, click on the link below, then click on the scroll icon to get back here, and click the button to return to the Poetry Engine scroll.

The scroll icon looks like this:

Once you can navigate there, try entering a new word in the field marked "text", and hitting "enter".  You should see one of the words get replaced by what you typed in.  To move a word around, just either drag a finger or pointer across the screen on a touch screen or click and drag with a mouse or pointer.  As soon as you make changes, click the "save" button, which is this icon:

This icon is used to denote save actions across the Geometron system.

Now to select other words, use the next and previous icons which look like this:

As you click through you should see the words selected appear in the "text" field. Any word can also be deleted using the "delete" button which looks the same across most of the Geometron system, and is just a red "X":

To add a new word, use the "add" button:

Whenever you change anything, always hit "save".  Then you can reload your browser and you'll still see the state of the Engine as you saved it.   Or, if there are multiple users, you'll see the most recent state from the most recent save of some other user.

Now, to actually use this, we'll need to find a target image.  To do that, think of a topic, any topic.  You can do image searches in search engines, but to begin with go find an image on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and get the address of the image by right-clicking on the image and selecting "copy image location". The go back to your Poetry Engine and paste that url into the field marked "image url".  The image you see should instantly switch to the one you found on Wikipedia. 


Save again, and notice that the larger text box is filled with strange looking code. Now copy all that code to the clipboard and paste it into an email or text message to another Geometron user. They can then paste that code into the same field and click the "IMPORT" button in the very lower right corner of their screen and it will load the whole of your poem to their screen. Ask them to send back one to you and you can import it in the same way, edit it, and send it back. If you ever want to reset everything because your page gets somehow corrupted, just hit the RESET button to restore a default poem.

Replicate and share!
