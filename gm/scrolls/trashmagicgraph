"Graph" here refers to a collection of things connected by flow arrows.  Trash magic centers on the [TRASH STATION](scrolls/trashstation), which is the community hub found in a public space where we share resources and products with people.  This is where people can hang out all day and exchange things and information with passerby freely.  We take in a flow of trash from the [TRASH FEED](scrolls/trashfeed), which we pass along to the makers in the [TRASH FACTORY](scrolls/trashfactory) who create products to distribute from the STATION.  We also are constantly sharing information to spread TRASH MAGIC by way of the education provided in the [TRASH ACADEMY](scrolls/trashacademy), which has a research arm represented by [TRASH LABS](scrolls/trashlabs)
