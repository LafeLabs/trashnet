**Action:** List resources here.  What are you willing to share or help with? List that.  As we pass the book from person to person, tell the next person to add to it.  As with all these prompts, it is OK to leave it blank and let the next person add to it.

Mutual aid.  Free stuff. Resources.  Use this document to post what's available to help and share locally, people, places, institutions, food, medicine, shelter, helpers of all kinds.
