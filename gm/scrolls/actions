# 12. Community Actions

[podcast episode](https://anchor.fm/trashrobot/episodes/Reading-from-Chapter-12-of-Geometron-Magic-COMMUNITY-ACTIONS-e1ta97h)


This is a book of direct action.  This is not an appeal to authority or an agenda or policy plan for existing organizations, but a framework for directly choosing to go build what we need to build.  Some of the things we need to build will take millions of people decades to build, and will require vast organizations which we can scarcely even conceive of today.  

All of this starts with simple direct actions using only the resources we have available to us right now.  In this chapter we go through the things we are asking as the creators of this work in order to grow this new economic system to the scale needed to solve global problems.  This requires a delicate balance between finding the *right* people with specialized skills who can build complex machines and dedicate their lives to creating new social structures and spreading our message and philosophy to a broad enough audience to provide community support for our core of creators.  We begin with the small steps that everyone can take.  This is magic, as defined in this work: the replication of desire to build this world, nothing more and nothing less.  Without this, nothing else will work. And if we get enough people to believe, we can do anything.

To spread these ideas, this book itself must replicate as broadly as possible.  This means we want the free digital form in as many formats and languages as possible on as many web pages and computers as possible, shared with as many people as possible.  We also want the physical bound copies from a professional printer to be distributed as widely as possible.  This is where the author's self-interest must be publicly declared: the most straight forward was for me, the author, to live off of this network is for people to buy so many of the physical bound book for dollars that I can live off it.  If I can live off of book sales, I can work on more books without any strings attached, and this will maximize my ability to push all this work to the next level without distractions.   Physical copies need not be purchased, they can be printed and bound yourself, by printing the letter size pdf and binding with a simple loose leaf or spiral binder.  Purchasing books is both to get higher quality bound volumes in a smaller format and to support the author.  Also you can be Trash Robot.  And then we are Trash Robot. Trash Robot is an art collective, and anyone can print and sell books without any permission or payments.  Just ask us how.

We are looking to saturate certain physical spaces with these ideas in order to activate those spaces into our network.  To do that, we ask people to buy or print as many copies as they feel they can and distribute them for free in public spaces where we aim to spread the network.  These books are not property.  In addition to being free of copyright since they are all published on a Public Domain license, we are asking you to never claim the physical volumes as property but to release them into the commons as well.  All of this is tied to the other physical elements of the network.  Our network is built into the physical street, with physical media and computer and network resources all focused along some area.  We look in that area for anyplace that can naturally hold public books and drop books there.  This includes libraries, book stores, coffee shops, waiting areas of medical offices, lobbies of apartment buildings, art galleries, schools, religious institutions, break rooms in work places, infoshops, "little free libraries", hotel rooms, and community houses.  All of these are strategic placements.  We are always using the placement of the book not to simply find readers at random but as a campaign to activate a specific place, to build a new emergent network of people in that space who share our common purpose.  We aim to place many copies within a couple mile radius of a location, rather than broadly distribute, and always the distribution is a means to an end, where we aim to expand the other physical elements of the network(media and machines).

Beyond the message carried in the book, the next thing we are asking from people who wish to replicate these ideas is the replication of the other physical media, which point to the digital media.  The simplest physical media is the patterns we can create using Action Geometry as a ritual artistic practice.  The simple geometric shapes described in the Action Geometry chapter can be created for free paper, pen and scissors(or even careful folding and tearing).  These can be used to create a whole universe of tiled patterns which can be used to spread the idea of self-replicating geometry.  These are very recognizable, and create a sort of brand identity which can be on any media.  This media can include cardboard signs held by people on the side of the street to wall murals, tattoos, chalk art on sidewalks, sewn patterns on clothing, Easter eggs on circuit boards and microchips, computer games, game boards, and really any new type of media we can think of.  Any pattern created with this system can be easily replicated by anyone using the same system.  This transmits not just symbols but the *idea* of using geometry to make self-replicating symbols.  That idea is the most important part of this, since it is the "magic" which drives the whole system, the replication of the desire to build this world of freely replicating things.

As with the books, these geometric patterns which can freely replicate will have the most impact on the growth of our network when they are displayed strategically in the physical locations we wish to activate into the network.  These physical media elements point to our digital media which describe the system, including the digital version of this book.  This can be as direct and physical as a cardboard sign next to a Raspberry Pi or it can be a sign pointing to a web address which hosts our collection of Magic Books which spreads the network.  

Fashion can be one of the most powerful forms of self-replicating media.  Shirts, pants, robes, dresses, skirts, cloaks, hats and accessories can all carry self-replicating geometric arrangements of shapes, where each instance is constructed using the shape set and construction methods of Action Geometry, and where the whole is used as a brand identity to spread the core message of our network.  If we use clothes and other cloth products which are discarded or donated, this further promotes our message through direct action: the article of clothing both embodies an ideal and transmits a geometric pattern which represents that ideal.  Furthermore, developing a tradition of creating extremely recognizable fashion based on our ideas and methods creates a very obvious identity in which we can recognize each other and be recognized in public, creating a more freely replicating culture.  This fashion culture also plants the seed for the full Trash Magic textile production we will produce in the Trash Factories when we start to establish more substantial industrial infrastructure in our system like mills and looms which create cloth from plastic bottles and industrial sewing machines creating patchwork trash cloth for use in new clothing and shelter products.  All of this clothing production, like everything we produce, is a hybrid of mutual aid directed at the most marginalized people and commercial products sold to support our ongoing operations.

All this can start simple.  Just a t-shirt with a couple stitched colored triangles with some obvious symmetry can require minimal skill and effort and no money to make, and can be enough to start a conversation which leads to spreading these ideas.  

The next replication action we ask of the reader is participation in the symbolic economy of Icon Magic.  This means designing, creating, and replicating the small pieces of physical media which carry the simple pixelated designs of icons drawn as Geometron glyphs which are described in the Icon Magic chapter.  For these to freely replicate, they must be distributed and used in a way where the clay prints and stamps are carried with their finished products, so that more can always be made with more clay.  The "factory" to produce more of these consists of just a block of polymer clay, access to a conventional oven, paint pens, and sand paper.  There are numerous other ways to replicate them, stamping symbols into heated plastic, or casting pourable materials like epoxy resin, silicone or chocolate.  As long as the original prints are available to make stamps, we have a system which can replicate an ever-increasing flow of media.  

These Icons can be used for many things.  In all cases, however, as with all the other media presented here, their primary purpose initially is simply to replicate the desire to replicate the system.  So we design them based on what we think people will care about for *anything* they might already care about.  They can be board game pieces, markers in public spaces, white rabbits which are to be found and direct people to online resources, used like cards or rune tablets for ceremonial purposes, used for all sorts of rituals, turned into jewelry and worn(earrings, cuff links, belt buckles, pendants, buttons), used as barter tokens for goods and services.  As discussed in the Icon Magic chapter any "thing" in the most abstract sense be it an idea, object, person, place, action or set of other things, can be represented by these pieces of self-replicating media.  

Participation in this economy starts with simply accepting the physical media from someone who already has them and passing them along.  As with all our media, this is not property, it is intended to flow as fast as possible from person to person to replicate all our ideas and culture.  Simply take and give, carry and share.  

The next level of complexity from simply sharing the Icon Magic media is replicating them yourself.  This means learning the clay craft, which you can learn from someone who already knows how to do it, and repeating it yourself.  Even easier than learning the clay craft is learning to design your own icons using the Geometron software on any given Geometron server.  This can be done on any Raspberry Pi server, and the only product is a sequence of numbers which forms the code for the Geometron glyph which is printed out by the printer robots made from trash.  This is just a text string, and can be copy/pasted via text, email, or direct replication from server to server across our network. Creating these icons can also be done by free commission, where you think of a symbol and ask someone who already knows the system to make it.  This simple act of thinking of a symbol you want is one of the most valuable in the growth of our system, as it is the signal which determines how the system focuses on what people care about.  This act is as simple as asking a robot operator to create a symbol.

While these pieces of media have many purposes, we must always remember that our objective of making everything free for everyone requires that we always provide resources to those who have the greatest need in any given community. This means that directly selling all these self-replicating media can and should be used as a way for people with nothing to support themselves.  If people on the street who need money can sell media which they can replicate indefinitely, they create a sort of mutual-aid based currency, in which the thing they sell to someone with more money and resources then represents the information that someone was helped, which can be transmitted through the rest of our social network.  Initially this looks a lot like a currency, like money, even though it is *not* money.  It is not money because it can be freely replicated by anyone, and because each icon *means* something.  Money is designed to *not* replicate freely, and to represent only number.   This is designed to represent a "thing" in an abstract sense which is *not* number, is an expression of a Geometron glyph which is pure information, and can replicate and evolve forever.  

We can make practical products this way which people would normally pay for, like attractive and interesting jewelry and completed board game sets like self-replicating chess sets.  This is a hybrid between viral media, craft production for profit, currency creation, and the generalized philosophical language of Icon Magic.

All of this Icon Magic media creation of course relies on physical machines to make the original prints.  This is done with the Trash Robot Geometron printer, made from old DVD drives, plastic trash, cardboard trash, duct tape, Arduino, and some simple off the shelf electronics.  All together, these robots cost about 50 dollars in parts, and can be assembled in a day.  The skills required are soldering, very basic electronics, and carefully cutting and taping trash into shapes(safe use of a box cutter).  We will spread the creation of these robots the same way as all the other parts of the system, where people who know how to build robots share with others.  If we can make the products of the robots worth something(both in money and in non-money value) that makes the robots worth something. If the robots have value and area easy to copy, they will replicate.  Once we get robots made out of trash replicating freely, we have the basis for building all the other things in our system.  This robot architecture can then be evolved into machines that make other machines, machines that make smaller and larger and more complex physical media(like printing books on plastic), agricultural automation, and all the other elements we need to build full Trash Magic and full Geometron as described in other chapters of this work.

Each physically local network hub requires that we build mixed reality media into a public space.  This is done with a combination of the physical media here and the digital media of the Magic Books and the infrastructure of the Pibrary.  Part of this is building the Map Book of a locality, which means writing text documents and creating maps which integrate stories and knowledge and links into the physical landscape.  This only requires that one or two people in any locality really understand our software.  The main labor is in the mental process of giving meaning to a space and sharing that meaning. For this we need story tellers, people who are good at connecting people, people who own or control shared spaces, people who spend their days occupying public spaces, and really anyone with an interest in this project to think of types of information they want embedded in a space and to talk with someone who can use the software to integrate all that media into the space.  An Operator who knows the system then compiles all these documents in a self-replicating form and replicates them to public facing web pages which are pointed to via the physical media in a physical space.  

This system is part of what makes our network financially viable.  Building the so-called Map Book or Street Book of a place can link people in a place, and that linking can create enormous economic benefit, which can be kept in the local community and used to materially support our operations.  In the simplest sense, this just means we advertise all the local small businesses in a given area and ask them in return to host our infrastructure for free and provide us with resources like free food and a place to work and live.  

The aforementioned Operator is someone who learned directly from an existing Operator how to create, edit, delete, and replicate all the documents in our system. We invite you to learn this by asking an existing Operator.  You will learn how to create text documents in this system, how to work with our maps, and how all the replication of Cybermagic works.  You will learn the ins and outs of the Raspberry Pi, enough to teach other people in the community to learn to use them, and will share them in public spaces with whoever has the greatest need for that resource.

In addition to the Raspberry Pi operators who know the software and basics of the Pi hardware, we need to train network operators who can build and maintain wireless networks which project free wifi into public spaces.  This means learning what to buy and how to install it for wireless point to point links and hotspots, as well as learning the logistics of setting up a dedicated Internet connection in a convenient location which is the source of the network connection.  We are not an ISP, and are not selling access.  We are simply training people on the level of one small space to create mutual aid based public wireless hot spots.  

All of our documents are also always replicated to public-facing web pages on domain names which are connected to physical locations, and we need to ask readers to help build these as well.  This means buying a domain and then paying for the monthly hosting costs.  In general we assume this will be done by the same people who are maintaining the Raspberry Pi infrastructure, as this is much easier than that, and is just a mirror of that.  A domain can cost as little as 10 dollars and hosting can be as little as 10 dollars a month, an insignificant cost for a network which provides any significant value to commerce in a local area.

The Cybermagic code which supports all this also needs developers who can learn how the code works, edit it, and replicate it out to the world using public open source code repositories.  As with all other elements of the system, we invite you to contact an existing developer to learn the system and replicate it.  The only skills you need to learn this are basic HTML and JavaScript along with a very basic understanding of what PHP does.  This can be learned from a combination of an existing Geometron developer and online free resources like w3schools.com and codepen.io.

This network is physical. So we need to physically integrate into a space in order to activate it into the network, and that means we need to travel and stay in places for days or weeks to fully replicate the system.  We are also asking readers to invite us, the creators of this network to stay at your home and work in your public spaces to build this.  If you can feed and house one of us for a week or two, we can build out all this for free.  

In order to build significant hardware infrastructure like long range solar powered wireless Internet links in rural areas, it will be useful to have funding which is not tied to commerce, but is simply there to build things.  To this end we need to get grants for network expansion.  These grants can come from any kind of sponsor who supports addressing "digital divide" issues.  Both physical access to computing/communication resources and the skill set to make use of those resources are one of the forces driving inequality in today's world.  Many governments and non profits recognize this issue and have earmarked significant funds to address both of these.  

Our system constructs free network access as well as free computers in public spaces targeting the most marginalized(starting with homeless and travelers) and trains the local community to use them.  This directly and in a very cost effective way addresses precisely the agendas of these sponsors.  Furthermore, each time we replicate the system, we are training people who are then qualified to further apply for grants to support further expansion.  Grants we are aiming for are to build things in a specific space.  They pay for our time for some period of training and building and also all the hardware.  We are aiming for grants in the range of 25-250 thousand dollars over from 2 weeks to a year.  Grants will be applied for in collaboration with existing non profits, preferably the public library or university.  Grants can be from national governments, tribal governments, large non-profits, or just donations from high net worth individuals or corporations.  We are asking readers who are grant writers, workers at a local non-profit, university faculty, librarians or local government people to collaborate to write these grants, and then to pay us, the creators of the network to live in your community and replicate all this.  We are also asking readers who fall into the sponsor category as government officials, high net worth individuals, or people at NGOs to help find the right grant recipients to put these collaborations together.  

The content of these grants is to buy Raspberry Pis, buy solar power stations, buy wireless network hardware, buy domains, and buy parts for the robots and art supplies, and then to train people in a local community to build physical social media which self-supports in the community.  Most grants meant to address the digital divide are not sustainable for communities since they train people to leave to get high paying technology jobs in cities.  Since this provides no direct benefit to communities, this means there always needs to be more grant money to sustain the program.  We provide a completely different model which is much more cost effective and sustainable, in which the product of our efforts is a *locally controlled* network with deep local knowledge which supports local commerce.  This makes the network financially self-sustaining without need for more grants, and keeps the technical skills we teach local, preventing the brain drain that makes a lot of workforce development programs in rural or economically depressed areas self-sabotaging.  

For now, the main things we are asking from our readers are what are listed above, which is just spreading the network and the idea of the network.  As the scale of our network grows, we are asking for people to create more and more complex new things.  We want people to write books! We need you to write all the books we need to build full Trash Magic.  If the network is self-supporting, this means you can make a living doing this!  Once our network grows, more and more people should be able to quit working for the consumer economy and move to working full time for the network off of the donations and revenue available from those getting benefit from it. When this becomes viable, we will be supported by the shared desire of the community and can focus entirely on the most important problems for building full Trash Magic.  We need you to tell us how to grow food everywhere, how to fabricate all medicines we need, how to build heat engines, harness flowing water, work with the soil to use it and improve on it and live in it, to tell our stories of our shared culture, to create art, and to just form the social matrix that connects all this together.  

The bigger we get and the more of these problems we can turn into self-replicating media, the easier all of this will get for all of us.  By directing all the benefit initially to the *most* marginalized people in the most public spaces, we grow those spaces and build a new civilization where the baseline of life is comfortable.  We want to abolish poverty not by moving everyone into a big house with a nice car but by making the tent cities in public spaces into places of luxury and abundance, with free medicine, free air conditioning, free food, free clean water and sanitation and so on.  This is our only path to freedom.  We must totally abolish the want of those who have the most want *first*.  When we do this, the vast store of human energy which is currently "not working" can form a social network where everyone has value, where just sharing in the community itself is considered a thing of value because it is part of how we replicate our whole civilization.

All of this is much closer than you think!  We can do it.  It just starts with spreading this message, it starts with this book, please share it and we can build all this!  As you learn things, teach them to others. As you build things, share them.  And please help us as you do this by creating media and sharing it, creating videos and other social media posts promoting all these ideas.  Every time someone shares all this, the whole network gets more powerful and we get closer to building our new world.
