# secondedition
 
The purpose of this book is to engage people in replication, evolution, and use of the system.

 - The motivation chapters at the beginning stay the same.  
 - The documentation of the symbolic programming language needs specific updates for the current mode of the software.   
 - Code replication is all part of cybermagic, the name I'm giving to self-replicating sets of digital information
 - Icon magic is the tentative name of the system of creating icons, printing them, carrying them around, and placing them on geometric game boards, which are themselves self-replicating.  Perhaps symbol magic is more fundamental.

Some software things

 - icon set should have .svg export
 - icon set should have .png base 64 code export
 - icon set should have .stl export
 - map set should have an example with an image set with maps using screen shots
 - a map set should have a set of replicator links in the replicator scroll one level up in a Book (do this for an actual place)

Possible choices for icon magic
 
- symbol magic
- token magic
- coin magic
- game board
- chaos magic
- the game of chaos
- board magic
