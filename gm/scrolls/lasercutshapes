To make these, download the files and then use them in a laser cutter or upload them to www.ponoko.com to get them made there.  For Ponoko you need vector graphics(.svg) with cutouts in one layer and etch in the other.  Be sure to make the width 6 inches for the rulers, and also 6 inches for the full shape set pattern.
