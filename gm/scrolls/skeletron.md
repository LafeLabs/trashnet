# Skeletron System

We begin by making the [ArtBox](scrolls/box.md) which is used to store art supplies and tools used for all other elements. 

Find bamboo groves or drift wood or similar sticks, cut to 6 foot lengths.  Drill 1/4 inch holes a few inches in from each end and also in the center of the stick.  Wrap in duct tape in rainbow stripes as shown. This is called the Trash Pole.

purchase large quantities of black nylon parachute cord and also clothesline.  Cut clothesline into lengths of 6 feet and wrap ends with duct tape to prevent fraying.  Cut nylon parachute cord into 18 inch segments, and burn each end with a lighter.

Use small ties to tie ends to create structures.  These can be used to make a simple tripod from which hang all the various elements of Trash Robot in bags.  The larger ties can be used to tie things together, tie things to objects, in the sigil boards documented elsewhere, for draw strings for large bags as well as the [ArtBox](scrolls/box.md).  Using small ties to tie together sticks at their ends can be used to make the [octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron), [tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron), and combinations of them to build up structures.  Those structures can be wrapped with blankets and tarps to make modular habitable shelters both for living and working as Trash Robt scales.

This structural system is based on the principle of [tensegrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity), a term coined by [Buckminster Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller), a primary influence in this work.

All work with Rainbow Duct Tape involves use of the Tape Snake.  To make a tape snake [purchase a pack of rainbow duct tape](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0877DRF5X/), remove the colors black, red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple and string them on a 6 foot clothes line based Trash Tie which loops all the way through twice, then is tied off with a square knot.

Objects in Trash Robot are hung from horizontal Trash Poles by way of the S-Hook.  S-Hooks are made by using a [Geometron Square](maps/shapes) as shown below to create 4 S patterns from thick corrugated cardboard, then binding them with rainbow duct tape and adding googly eyes as shown below.

## Boards

Use [shapes](scrolls/shapes) and Tape Snake and Trash Tie from [skeletron](scrolls/skeletron.md) to make board. Rainbow tape, googly eyes, geometric patterns.  Put the icon coins on the boards.  Board is used to arrange icon coins in patterns of conceptual relation to play around with how the information relates to itself, so the [magician](scrolls/magic.md) can better control the system.

## Replicator Cards

Replicator cards are cardboard cut out large enough to tape a index card to, with duct tape on the opposite side...or any other Tarot-like or index-card-like card which can carry physical information.  These are used to map out the same set being replicated in the [Trash Robot Alchemy Process](scrolls/alchemy.md), but they carry actual information on how to replicate that element.  This can be geometric designs, keywords, urls, names of files, lists of parts etc. They can be anything which helps a person replicate the thing they represent.
