## Structural Elements of the System:

Languages: PHP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Markdown, JSON

To edit the code and see it with syntax highlighting on a live machine, go to [editor.php](editor.php).

THERE ARE NO DATABASES

 - [replicator.php](php/replicator.txt): replicates the system using the file [data/dna.txt](data/dna.txt)
 - [fileloader.php](php/fileloader.txt): loads and prints files from the server filesystem 
 - [filesaver.php](php/filesaver.txt): saves files to the server filesystem
 - [editor.php](php/editor.txt): a general code editor which can edit all parts of the system, and formats code using the [Ace.js library](https://ace.c9.io/)
 - [text2php.php](php/text2php.txt): a script which copies every file in the php directory(all of which use the .txt extension so browsers can read them) into the main directory with the .php extension so that they can run.  This prevents editor.php from breaking things in real time while they are edited.
 - [dnagenerator.php](php/dnagenerator.txt): this script reads from the server file system to see what files exist and put them in the file [data/dna.txt](data/dna.txt) so that the replicator can find them all using the dna
 - [setreplicator.php](php/setreplicator.txt): copies a set of files described by the JSON file [data/set.txt](data/set.txt)
 - [removephp.php](php/removephp.txt): removes all .php scripts, making the page passive.  This will break fileloader.php which breaks index.html, so it can also be used with the "keeploader" flag with fileloader.php?keeploader to keep the loader and delete all other .php scripts to avoid a page getting edited if it faces the wider Internet and you don't want it "hacked"
 - [setreplicator.php](php/setreplicator.txt): a script which copies all the files listed in [data/set.txt](data/set.txt)
 - [mkdir.php](php/mkdir.txt): makes a new directory using mkdir
 - [dir.php](php/dir.txt): list contents of a directory
 - [rdelete.php](php/rdelete.txt): recursively delete everything in a directory or any given thing.  This totally destroys all contents of something instantly with no undo
 - [README.md](README.md): this document. By default index.html and readme.html both read this, and it is also by default the document seen on the github repository
 - [readme.html](readme.html): a page which reads the README and converts it to html for easy viewing in a browser
 - [index.html](index.html): home page, where browsers start pointing to.  Edit to anything using editor.php.  There are no limits to what this can do.
 - [scrolleditor.html](scrolleditor.html): the editor for markdown files, in this case just README.md but if you replicate a more full version of Geometron it can edit an arbitrary number of markdown files, and it is easily edited using editor.php to edit other types of file of all kinds
 - [set.html](set.html):  The operation page for the self-replicating set of files found in [data/set.txt](data/set.txt) which points to source and destination locations
 - [fork.html](fork.html): lists directories with links to all of them, allows for creating new directories and also deleting any directory
 - [data/dna.txt](data/dna.txt): a JSON file which lists all the files replicated by replicator.php
 - [data/set.txt](data/set.txt): a JSON file which lists files to replicate using setreplicator.php
