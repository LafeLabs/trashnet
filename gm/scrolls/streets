# STREETS

**Action:** List the streets which define where you are, in order from large to small scale.  

There is always a highway.  There are always medium sized roads.  Always a local street, always a shopping center or parking lot, always a street corner and a cross roads.  Identify them.  Describe them. Link them.  We build networks along the streets of the world, all over the world. Not as part of any local property but as shared links of the physical network of the world.
