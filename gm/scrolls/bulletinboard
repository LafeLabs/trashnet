# BULLETIN BOARD

**Action:** Post an advertisement for whatever you want to promote.  Or pass the book along to someone else who can promote their thing.  Make the post as small as possible to leave room for more posts. This can expand to a whole separate volume if needed.  This is a free replacement for for-profit social media, a physical bulletin board. 

This is where people can promote their stuff. Advertise what you're selling, connect with people, promote your art, promote your music, promote your business, promote your non profit, find your people.

This should be a very active document.
