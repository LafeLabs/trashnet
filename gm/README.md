# Pibrary Geometron Magic in TRASHNET server

 - [gm.trshrobot.org](https://gm.trashrobot.org)
 - [TRASHNET server replicator](https://github.com/LafeLabs/trashnet)

With a TRASH DUMP SERVER set up, point the subdomain gm.[trashnet domain] to the home IP address where the server is.  Forward traffic for that subdomain to port 8080.  Create the appropriate virtual hosts file.  Create the fork in the TRASHNET and then replicate the pibrary replicator and run it using replicators.html.  Copy the appropriate PIBRARY book using the scroll set replicator here:

```

```
(put that into the "source server" field in scrollset.html and click the pink link to replicate the set)
